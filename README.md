# Random Password Generator
This project involves creating a random password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app will generate strong passwords that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, ensuring a high level of security. 
Additionally, we will implement a convenient password copy icon, allowing users to easily copy the newly generated password to their clipboard. 
This mini project is an excellent opportunity for beginners to practice their JavaScript skills and learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling with CSS. 
By the end of this project, you'll have a functional and visually appealing password generator that can be used in real-world applications.
